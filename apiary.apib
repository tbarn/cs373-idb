Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation. Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century. Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine. Coffee, specifically espresso, has become important in Italian cuisine.",
