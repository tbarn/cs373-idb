For the graders: 
Our models.py is actually app.py. According to Downing, we do not need a models.py. This causes models.html to be app.html. 

Needed libraries to run app: flask

Needed libraries to run tests: requests and unittest

To run unit tests locally on the UTCS machines, run: python3 tests.py
